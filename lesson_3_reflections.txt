When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Using a remote repository facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple users to 
  interact with the project. It could even be helpful when working on a completely
  individual project by creating a hub for the project that you can interact with 
  from multiple computers.
