When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Using a remote repository facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple users to 
  interact with the project. It could even be helpful when working on a completely
  individual project by creating a hub for the project that you can interact with 
  from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes manually could be helpful to ensure that your work on a project
	isn't thrown off by project updates made by another user. Waiting to sync until
	your work is ready could be prudent.
